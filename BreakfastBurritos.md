#Hello World
It is *8 o'clock* in the morning and I am very tired. I never know what to write. It's like I forget what words exist and
how to string them together as soon as I have to think creatively. Here's a recipe for breakfast burritos. Cool!
**Ingredients:**
1. 4 Large Flour Tortillas
2. 8 Large Eggs
3. 2 Cans Hatch Green Chiles 
4. .5 Teaspoon Cumin
5. .5 Garlic Powder
6. .25 Teaspoon Paprika
7. 1/2 Cup Chicken Broth
9. 1.5 Cups Medium Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Grated
11. 2 Russet Potatoes
12. Oil or Lard (for making the harshy-browns)
13. 2 packs Breakfast Sausage links
14. Salt and Pepper 

Okay looks like a lot of things but these are really good.
**Method:**
1. Peel the potatoes and grate them with a cheese crader
2. Once grated, place a two halves of a paper towel in an "X" pattern on a bowl and then put grated potato in the bowl.
3. Grab paper towel halves, wrap your hands around greated potato and squeeze all the water out of them tatters
5. Get a fry pan out and on medium/medium high heat on the stove
6. Put enough oil or lard in the pan to coat the bottom
7. Once oil begins to shimmer form the potato into little mounds and watch your hands as you drop the hash browns in the pan
8. As the hash browns are working combine the chicken stock, can of green chiles, cumin, garlic powder, paprika, and salt and pepper to taste in a little pot. Keep warm.
9. Now it is time to scramble some eggs. Crack eggs into a bowl and season.
10. Get a nonstick pan on the stove, put a little nob of a butter in there. Once butter melts drop in eggs. 
11. Make sure pan isn't too hot. If I hear a sizzle I will not on your door with Gordon Ramsey and begin to yell so much he would even be impressed.
12. Scramble them huevos.
13. **OKAY** I realize a lot of steps, trust me this was a lot to type out. It's worth it.
14. Put tortillas in microwaved and heat until pliable.
**Assembly**
Gather the *properly* scrambled eggs, cheese, hash browns, and green chiles.
